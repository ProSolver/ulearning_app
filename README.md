We also built reusable widget to reduce code amount. So at the end of this tutorial you learn how to build simple to complex reusable flutter widgets. Eventually we will master Firebase chatting and building API and interact with the servers with three ways.



State Management

We used BLoC to manage state and as well for routing.

We used Laravel framework for building backend and API. Backend has multi user privileges. It means there are super admins and sub admins. Teachers accounts are sub admin. Super admin can observe and assign roles to the teachers or the sub admins.
