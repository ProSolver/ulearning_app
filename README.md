This app covers Flutter for very beginners to advanced learners. We start from very simple ui like drawing text to complex layout.

We also built reusable widget to reduce code amount. So at the end of this tutorial you learn how to build simple to complex reusable flutter widgets. Eventually we will master Firebase chatting and building API and interact with the servers with three ways.



State Management

We used BLoC to manage state and as well for routing.

Backend

We used Laravel framework for building backend and API. Backend has multi user privileges. It means there are super admins and sub admins. Teachers accounts are sub admin. Super admin can observe and assign roles to the teachers or the sub admins.

Firebase

Firebase is used for email login and third party login like Google, Facebook and Apple.
